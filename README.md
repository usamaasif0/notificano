{
    return $this->hasMany(\Notificano\Models\Notification::class, 'to_user');
}
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Add the Notification Bell to Your Layout

**Blade Directive (recommended):**
```blade
@notificanoBell
```

### 2. Configuration

Publish and edit `config/notificano.php` to adjust settings (e.g., max notifications shown):
```php
return [
    'max_notifications' => 5,
];
```

## Customization
- You can override the published views in your app's `resources/views/vendor/notificano/` directory.
- Change the default avatar image by replacing `public/images/no_avatar.webp`.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Notifications table missing?** Run migrations after publishing.
- **Not seeing the bell?** Make sure you are logged in and have included `@notificanoBell` in your layout.
- **Auth issues?** Ensure your routes use both `web` and `auth` middleware.
- **Custom user model?** The package auto-detects your user model via Laravel config.
